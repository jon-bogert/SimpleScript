    text: EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT - LARS HOMESTEAD - AFTERNOON
  - type: Action
    text: The Jawas mutter gibberish as they busily line up their battered captives, including Artoo and Threepio, in front of the enormous Sandcrawler, which is parked beside a small homestead consisting of three large holes in the ground surrounded by several tall moisture vaporators and one small adobe block house.
  - type: Action
    text: The Jawas scurry around fussing over the robots, straightening them up or brushing some dust from a dented metallic elbow. The shrouded little creatures smell horribly, attracting small insects to the dark areas when their mouths and nostrils should be. 
  - type: Action
    text: Out of the shadows of a dingy side-building limps Owen Lars, a large burly man in his mid-fifties. His reddish eyes are sunken in a dust-covered face. As the farmer carefully inspects each robot, he is closely followed by his slump shouldered nephew, Luke Skywalker. One of the vile little Jawas walks ahead of the farmer spouting an animated sales pitch in a queer, unintelligible language.
  - type: Action
    text: A voice calls out from one of the huge holes that form the homestead. Luke goes over to the edge and sees his Aunt Beru standing in the main courtyard.
  - type: Dialogue
    character: BERU
    text: Luke, tell Owen that if he gets a translator to be sure it speaks Bocce.
  - type: Dialogue
    character: LUKE
    text: It looks like we don't have much of a choice but I'll remind him. Luke returns to his uncle as they look over the equipment for sale with the Jawa leader.
  - type: Dialogue
    character: OWEN
    text: I have no need for a protocol droid.
  - type: Parenthetical
    character: THREEPIO
    text: quickly
  - type: Dialogue
    character: THREEPIO
    text: Sir -- not in an environment such as this -- that's why I've also secondary functions that...
  - type: Dialogue
    character: OWEN
    text: What I really need is a droid that understands the binary language of moisture vaporators.
  - type: Dialogue
    character: THREEPIO
    text: Vaporators! Sir -- My first job was programming binary load lifter... very similar to your vaporators. You could say...
  - type: Dialogue
    character: OWEN
    text: Do you speak Bocce?
  - type: Dialogue
    character: THREEPIO
    text: Of course I can, sir. It's like a second language for me... I'm as fluent in Bocce...
  - type: Dialogue
    character: OWEN
    text: All right shut up!
  - type: Parenthetical
    character: OWEN
    text: turning to Jawa
  - type: Dialogue

  - type: Dialogue

    text: Shutting up, sir.
  - type: Dialogue
    character: OWEN
    text: Luke, take these two over to the garage, will you? I want you to have both of them cleaned up before dinner.
  - type: Dialogue
    character: LUKE
    text: But I was going into Toshi Station to pick up some power converters...
  - type: Dialogue
    character: OWEN
    text: You can waste time with your friends when your chores are done. Now come on, get to it!
  - type: Dialogue
    character: LUKE
    text: All right, come on! And the red one, come on. Well, come on, Red, let's go.
  - type: Action
    text: As the Jawas start to lead the three remaining robots back into the Sandcrawler, Artoo lets out a pathetic little beep and starts after his old friend Threepio. He is restrained by a slimy Jawa, who zaps him with a control box.
  - type: Action
    text: Owen is negotiating with the head Jawa. Luke and the two robots start off for the garage when a plate pops off the head of the red astro-droid's head plate and it sparks wildly.
  - type: Dialogue
    character: LUKE
    text: Uncle Owen...
  - type: Dialogue
    character: OWEN
    text: Yeah?
  - type: Dialogue
    character: LUKE
    text: This R2 unit has a bad motivator. Look!
  - type: Parenthetical
    character: OWEN
    text: to the head Jawa
  - type: Dialogue
    character: OWEN
    text: Hey, what're you trying to push on us?
  - type: Action
    text: The Jawa goes into a loud spiel. Meanwhile, Artoo has sneaked out of line and is moving up and down trying to attract attention. He lets out with a low whistle. Threepio taps Luke on the shoulder.
  - type: Parenthetical
    character: THREEPIO
    text: pointing to Artoo
  - type: Dialogue
    character: THREEPIO
    text: Excuse me, sir, but that R2 unit is in prime condition. A real bargain.
  - type: Dialogue
    character: LUKE
    text: Uncle Owen...
  - type: Dialogue
    character: OWEN
    text: Yeah?
  - type: Dialogue
    character: LUKE
    text: What about that one?
  - type: Parenthetical
    character: OWEN
    text: to Jawa
  - type: Dialogue
    character: OWEN
    text: What about that blue one? We'll take that one.
  - type: Action
    text: With a little reluctance the scruffy dwarf trades the damaged astro-droid for Artoo.
  - type: Dialogue
    character: LUKE
    text: Yeah, take it away.
  - type: Dialogue
    character: THREEPIO
    text: Uh, I'm quite sure you'll be very pleased with that one, sir. He really is in first-class condition. I've worked with him before. Here he comes.
  - type: Action
    text: Owen pays off the whining Jawa as Luke and the two robots trudge off toward a grimy homestead entry.
  - type: Dialogue
    character: LUKE
    text: Okay, let's go.
  - type: Parenthetical
    character: THREEPIO
    text: to Artoo
  - type: Dialogue
    character: THREEPIO
    text: Now, don't you forget this! Why I should stick my neck out for you is quite beyond my capacity!
  - type: Slug
    text: INT. LARS HOMESTEAD - GARAGE AREA - LATE AFTERNOON
  - type: Action
    text: The garage is cluttered and worn, but a friendly peaceful atmosphere permeates the low grey chamber. Threepio lowers himself into a large tub filled with warm oil. Near the battered Landspeeder little Artoo rests on a large battery with a cord to his face.
  - type: Dialogue
    character: THREEPIO
    text: Thank the maker! This oil bath is going to feel so good. I've got such a bad case of dust contamination, I can barely move!
  - type: Action
    text: Artoo beeps a muffled reply. Luke seems to be lost in thought as he runs his hand over the damaged fin of a small two-man Skyhopper spaceship resting in a low hangar off the garage. Finally Luke's frustrations get the better of him and he slams a wrench across the workbench.
  - type: Dialogue
    character: LUKE
    text: It just isn't fair. Oh, Biggs is right. I'm never gonna get out of here!
  - type: Dialogue
    character: THREEPIO
    text: Is there anything I might do to help?
  - type: Action
    text: Luke glances at the battered robot. A bit of his anger drains and a tiny smile creeps across his face.
  - type: Dialogue
    character: LUKE
    text: Well, not unless you can alter time, speed up the harvest, or teleport me off this rock!
  - type: Dialogue
    character: THREEPIO
    text: I don't think so, sir. I'm only a droid and not very knowledgeable about such things. Not on this planet, anyways. As a matter of fact, I'm not even sure which planet I'm on.
  - type: Dialogue
    character: LUKE
    text: Well, if there's a bright center to the universe, you're on the planet that it's farthest from.
  - type: Dialogue
    character: THREEPIO
    text: I see, sir.
  - type: Dialogue
    character: LUKE
    text: Uh, you can call me Luke.
  - type: Dialogue
    character: THREEPIO
    text: I see, sir Luke.

    text: laughing
  - type: Dialogue

  - type: Dialogue

    text: And I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg relations, and this is my counterpart, Artoo-Detoo.
  - type: Dialogue
    character: LUKE
    text: Hello.
  - type: Action
    text: Artoo beeps in response. Luke unplugs Artoo and begins to scrape several connectors on the robot's head with a chrome pick. Threepio climbs out of the oil tub and begins wiping oil from his bronze body.
  - type: Dialogue
    character: LUKE
    text: You got a lot of carbon scoring here. It looks like you boys have seen a lot of action.
  - type: Dialogue
    character: THREEPIO
    text: With all we've been through, sometimes I'm amazed we're in as good condition as we are, what with the Rebellion and all.
  - type: Dialogue
    character: LUKE
    text: You know of the Rebellion against the Empire?
  - type: Dialogue
    character: THREEPIO
    text: That's how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning, sir.
  - type: Dialogue
    character: LUKE
    text: Have you been in many battles?
  - type: Dialogue
    character: THREEPIO
    text: Several, I think. Actually, there's not much to tell. I'm not much more than an interpreter, and not very good at telling stories. Well, not at making them interesting, anyways.
  - type: Action
    text: Luke struggles to remove a small metal fragment from Artoo's neck joint. He uses a larger pick.
  - type: Dialogue
    character: LUKE
    text: Well, my little friend, you've got something jammed in here real good. Were you on a cruiser or...
  - type: Action
    text: The fragment breaks loose with a snap, sending Luke tumbling head over heels. He sits up and sees a twelve-inch threedimensional hologram of Leia Organa, the Rebel senator, being projected from the face of little Artoo. The image is a rainbow of colors as it flickers and jiggles in the dimly lit garage. Luke's mouth hangs open in awe.
  - type: Dialogue
    character: LEIA
    text: Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope.
  - type: Dialogue
    character: LUKE
    text: What's this?
  - type: Action
    text: Artoo looks around and sheepishly beeps an answer for Threepio to translate. Leia continues to repeat the sentence fragment over and over.
  - type: Dialogue
    character: THREEPIO
    text: What is what?!? He asked you a question...
  - type: Parenthetical
    character: THREEPIO
    text: pointing to Leia
  - type: Dialogue
    character: THREEPIO
    text: What is that?
  - type: Action
    text: Artoo whistles his surprise as he pretends to just notice the hologram. He looks around and sheepishly beeps an answer for Threepio to translate. Leia continues to repeat the sentence fragment over and over.
  - type: Dialogue
    character: LEIA
    text: Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope.
  - type: Dialogue
    character: THREEPIO
    text: Oh, he says it's nothing, sir. Merely a malfunction. Old data. Pay it no mind. Luke becomes intrigued by the beautiful girl.
  - type: Dialogue
    character: LUKE
    text: Who is she? She's beautiful.
  - type: Dialogue
    character: THREEPIO
    text: I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.
  - type: Dialogue
    character: LEIA
    text: Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi...
  - type: Dialogue
    character: THREEPIO
    text: I think she was a passenger on our last voyage. A person of some importance, sir -- I believe. Our captain was attached to...
  - type: Dialogue
    character: LUKE
    text: Is there more to this recording?
  - type: Action
    text: Luke reaches out for Artoo but he lets out several frantic squeaks and a whistle.
  - type: Dialogue
    character: THREEPIO
    text: Behave yourself, Artoo. You're going to get us in trouble. It's all right, you can trust him. He's our new master.
  - type: Action
    text: Artoo whistles and beeps a long message to Threepio.
  - type: Dialogue
    character: THREEPIO
    text: He says he's the property of Obi-Wan Kenobi, a resident of these parts. And it's a private message for him. Quite frankly, sir I don't know what he's talking about. Our last master was Captain Antilles, but with what we've been through, this little R2 unit has become a bit eccentric.
  - type: Dialogue
    character: LUKE
    text: Obi-Wan Kenobi? I wonder if he means old Ben Kenobi?
  - type: Dialogue
    character: THREEPIO
    text: I beg your pardon, sir, but do you know what he's talking about?
  - type: Dialogue
    character: LUKE
    text: Well, I don't know anyone named Obi-Wan, but old Ben lives out beyond the dune sea. He's kind of a strange old hermit.
  - type: Action
    text: Luke's gazes at the beautiful young princess for a few moments.
  - type: Dialogue
    character: LUKE
    text: I wonder who she is. It sounds like she's in trouble. I'd better play back the whole thing. Artoo beeps something to Threepio.
  - type: Dialogue
    character: THREEPIO
    text: He says the restraining bolt has short circuited his recording system. He suggests that if you remove the bolt, he might be able to play back the entire recording. Luke looks longingly at the lovely, little princess and hasn't really heard what Threepio has been saying.
  - type: Dialogue
    character: LUKE
    text: H'm? Oh, yeah, well, I guess you're too small to run away on me if I take this off! Okay.
  - type: Action
    text: Luke takes a wedged bar and pops the restraining bolt off Artoo's side.
  - type: Dialogue
    character: LUKE
    text: There you go.
  - type: Action
    text: The princess immediately disappears...
  - type: Dialogue
    character: LUKE
    text: Well, wait a minute. Where'd she go? Bring her back! Play back the entire message.
  - type: Action
    text: Artoo beeps an innocent reply as Threepio sits up in embarrassment.
  - type: Dialogue
    character: THREEPIO
    text: What message? The one you're carrying inside your rusty innards!
  - type: Action

  - type: Dialogue

    text: Luke? Luke! Come to dinner!
  - type: Action

  - type: Dialogue
    character: LUKE
    text: All right, I'll be right there, Aunt Beru.
  - type: Dialogue
    character: THREEPIO
    text: I'm sorry, sir, but he appears to have picked up a slight flutter.
  - type: Action
    text: Luke tosses Artoo's restraining bolt on the workbench and hurries out of the room.
  - type: Dialogue
    character: LUKE
    text: Well, see what you can do with him. I'll be right back.
  - type: Parenthetical
    character: THREEPIO
    text: to Artoo
  - type: Dialogue
    character: THREEPIO
    text: Just you reconsider playing that message for him.
  - type: Action
    text: Artoo beeps in response.
  - type: Dialogue
    character: THREEPIO
    text: No, I don't think he likes you at all.
  - type: Action
    text: Artoo beeps.
  - type: Dialogue
    character: THREEPIO
    text: No, I don't like you either.

    content: EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT - LARS HOMESTEAD - AFTERNOON
  - type: Action
    content: The Jawas mutter gibberish as they busily line up their battered captives, including Artoo and Threepio, in front of the enormous Sandcrawler, which is parked beside a small homestead consisting of three large holes in the ground surrounded by several tall moisture vaporators and one small adobe block house.
  - type: Action
    content: The Jawas scurry around fussing over the robots, straightening them up or brushing some dust from a dented metallic elbow. The shrouded little creatures smell horribly, attracting small insects to the dark areas when their mouths and nostrils should be. 
  - type: Action
    content: Out of the shadows of a dingy side-building limps Owen Lars, a large burly man in his mid-fifties. His reddish eyes are sunken in a dust-covered face. As the farmer carefully inspects each robot, he is closely followed by his slump shouldered nephew, Luke Skywalker. One of the vile little Jawas walks ahead of the farmer spouting an animated sales pitch in a queer, unintelligible language.
  - type: Action
    content: A voice calls out from one of the huge holes that form the homestead. Luke goes over to the edge and sees his Aunt Beru standing in the main courtyard.

  - type: Dialogue
    character: OWEN
    content: Do you speak Bocce?
  - type: Dialogue
    character: THREEPIO

  - type: Dialogue
    character: OWEN
    content: You can waste time with your friends when your chores are done. Now come on, get to it!
  - type: Dialogue
    character: LUKE
    content: All right, come on! And the red one, come on. Well, come on, Red, let's go.
  - type: Action
    content: As the Jawas start to lead the three remaining robots back into the Sandcrawler, Artoo lets out a pathetic little beep and starts after his old friend Threepio. He is restrained by a slimy Jawa, who zaps him with a control box.
  - type: Action
    content: Owen is negotiating with the head Jawa. Luke and the two robots start off for the garage when a plate pops off the head of the red astro-droid's head plate and it sparks wildly.

    content: Hey, what're you trying to push on us?
  - type: Action

    character: THREEPIO
    content: pointing to Artoo
  - type: Dialogue
    character: THREEPIO

  - type: Dialogue
    character: OWEN
    content: What about that blue one? We'll take that one.
  - type: Action

  - type: Dialogue
    character: LUKE
    content: Yeah, take it away.
  - type: Dialogue
    character: THREEPIO
    content: Uh, I'm quite sure you'll be very pleased with that one, sir. He really is in first-class condition. I've worked with him before. Here he comes.
  - type: Action
    content: Owen pays off the whining Jawa as Luke and the two robots trudge off toward a grimy homestead entry.
  - type: Dialogue
    character: LUKE
    content: Okay, let's go.
  - type: Parenthetical
    character: THREEPIO
    content: to Artoo
  - type: Dialogue
    character: THREEPIO

    content: INT. LARS HOMESTEAD - GARAGE AREA - LATE AFTERNOON
  - type: Action
    content: The garage is cluttered and worn, but a friendly peaceful atmosphere permeates the low grey chamber. Threepio lowers himself into a large tub filled with warm oil. Near the battered Landspeeder little Artoo rests on a large battery with a cord to his face.
  - type: Dialogue
    character: THREEPIO
    content: Thank the maker! This oil bath is going to feel so good. I've got such a bad case of dust contamination, I can barely move!
  - type: Action
    content: Artoo beeps a muffled reply. Luke seems to be lost in thought as he runs his hand over the damaged fin of a small two-man Skyhopper spaceship resting in a low hangar off the garage. Finally Luke's frustrations get the better of him and he slams a wrench across the workbench.
  - type: Dialogue
    character: LUKE
    content: It just isn't fair. Oh, Biggs is right. I'm never gonna get out of here!
  - type: Dialogue
    character: THREEPIO
    content: Is there anything I might do to help?
  - type: Action
    content: Luke glances at the battered robot. A bit of his anger drains and a tiny smile creeps across his face.
  - type: Dialogue
    character: LUKE
    content: Well, not unless you can alter time, speed up the harvest, or teleport me off this rock!
  - type: Dialogue
    character: THREEPIO
    content: I don't think so, sir. I'm only a droid and not very knowledgeable about such things. Not on this planet, anyways. As a matter of fact, I'm not even sure which planet I'm on.
  - type: Dialogue
    character: LUKE
    content: Well, if there's a bright center to the universe, you're on the planet that it's farthest from.
  - type: Dialogue

    content: Hello.
  - type: Action

  - type: Dialogue
    character: LUKE
    content: You got a lot of carbon scoring here. It looks like you boys have seen a lot of action.
  - type: Dialogue
    character: THREEPIO
    content: With all we've been through, sometimes I'm amazed we're in as good condition as we are, what with the Rebellion and all.

    character: LUKE
    content: You know of the Rebellion against the Empire?
  - type: Dialogue
    character: THREEPIO

  - type: Dialogue
    character: LUKE
    content: Have you been in many battles?
  - type: Dialogue
    character: THREEPIO
    content: Several, I think. Actually, there's not much to tell. I'm not much more than an interpreter, and not very good at telling stories. Well, not at making them interesting, anyways.
  - type: Action
    content: Luke struggles to remove a small metal fragment from Artoo's neck joint. He uses a larger pick.
  - type: Dialogue
    character: LUKE
    content: Well, my little friend, you've got something jammed in here real good. Were you on a cruiser or...
  - type: Action
    content: The fragment breaks loose with a snap, sending Luke tumbling head over heels. He sits up and sees a twelve-inch threedimensional hologram of Leia Organa, the Rebel senator, being projected from the face of little Artoo. The image is a rainbow of colors as it flickers and jiggles in the dimly lit garage. Luke's mouth hangs open in awe.
  - type: Dialogue
    character: LEIA
    content: Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope.
  - type: Dialogue
    character: LUKE
    content: What's this?
  - type: Action
    content: Artoo looks around and sheepishly beeps an answer for Threepio to translate. Leia continues to repeat the sentence fragment over and over.
  - type: Dialogue
    character: THREEPIO
    content: What is what?!? He asked you a question...
  - type: Parenthetical
    character: THREEPIO
    content: pointing to Leia
  - type: Dialogue
    character: THREEPIO
    content: What is that?
  - type: Action

  - type: Dialogue
    character: LEIA
    content: Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope.
  - type: Dialogue
    character: THREEPIO
    content: Oh, he says it's nothing, sir. Merely a malfunction. Old data. Pay it no mind. Luke becomes intrigued by the beautiful girl.
  - type: Dialogue
    character: LUKE
    content: Who is she? She's beautiful.
  - type: Dialogue
    character: THREEPIO

    content: Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi...
  - type: Dialogue

  - type: Action
    content: Luke reaches out for Artoo but he lets out several frantic squeaks and a whistle.
  - type: Dialogue
    character: THREEPIO
    content: Behave yourself, Artoo. You're going to get us in trouble. It's all right, you can trust him. He's our new master.
  - type: Action
    content: Artoo whistles and beeps a long message to Threepio.
  - type: Dialogue
    character: THREEPIO
    content: He says he's the property of Obi-Wan Kenobi, a resident of these parts. And it's a private message for him. Quite frankly, sir I don't know what he's talking about. Our last master was Captain Antilles, but with what we've been through, this little R2 unit has become a bit eccentric.
  - type: Dialogue
    character: LUKE
    content: Obi-Wan Kenobi? I wonder if he means old Ben Kenobi?
  - type: Dialogue
    character: THREEPIO
    content: I beg your pardon, sir, but do you know what he's talking about?
  - type: Dialogue
    character: LUKE
    content: Well, I don't know anyone named Obi-Wan, but old Ben lives out beyond the dune sea. He's kind of a strange old hermit.
  - type: Action
    content: Luke's gazes at the beautiful young princess for a few moments.
  - type: Dialogue
    character: LUKE
    content: I wonder who she is. It sounds like she's in trouble. I'd better play back the whole thing. Artoo beeps something to Threepio.
  - type: Dialogue
    character: THREEPIO
    content: He says the restraining bolt has short circuited his recording system. He suggests that if you remove the bolt, he might be able to play back the entire recording. Luke looks longingly at the lovely, little princess and hasn't really heard what Threepio has been saying.
  - type: Dialogue
    character: LUKE
    content: H'm? Oh, yeah, well, I guess you're too small to run away on me if I take this off! Okay.
  - type: Action
    content: Luke takes a wedged bar and pops the restraining bolt off Artoo's side.
  - type: Dialogue
    character: LUKE
    content: There you go.
  - type: Action

  - type: Dialogue
    character: LUKE

  - type: Dialogue

    character: THREEPIO
    content: to Artoo
  - type: Dialogue
    character: THREEPIO
    content: Just you reconsider playing that message for him.
  - type: Action
    content: Artoo beeps in response.
  - type: Dialogue
    character: THREEPIO
    content: No, I don't think he likes you at all.
  - type: Action
    content: Artoo beeps.
  - type: Dialogue
    character: THREEPIO
    content: No, I don't like you either.

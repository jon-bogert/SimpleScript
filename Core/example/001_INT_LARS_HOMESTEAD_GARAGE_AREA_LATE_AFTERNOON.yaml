    text: INT. LARS HOMESTEAD - GARAGE AREA - LATE AFTERNOON
  - type: Action
    text: The garage is cluttered and worn, but a friendly peaceful atmosphere permeates the low grey chamber. Threepio lowers himself into a large tub filled with warm oil. Near the battered Landspeeder little Artoo rests on a large battery with a cord to his face.

    character: THREEPIO
    text: Thank the maker! This oil bath is going to feel so good. I've got such a bad case of dust contamination, I can barely move!
  - type: Action
    text: Artoo beeps a muffled reply. Luke seems to be lost in thought as he runs his hand over the damaged fin of a small two-man Skyhopper spaceship resting in a low hangar off the garage. Finally Luke's frustrations get the better of him and he slams a wrench across the workbench.

    character: LUKE
    text: It just isn't fair. Oh, Biggs is right. I'm never gonna get out of here!
  - type: Dialogue
    character: THREEPIO
    text: Is there anything I might do to help?
  - type: Action

  - type: Dialogue
    character: LUKE
    text: Well, not unless you can alter time, speed up the harvest, or teleport me off this rock!
  - type: Dialogue
    character: THREEPIO
    text: I don't think so, sir. I'm only a droid and not very knowledgeable about such things. Not on this planet, anyways. As a matter of fact, I'm not even sure which planet I'm on.
  - type: Dialogue
    character: LUKE
    text: Well, if there's a bright center to the universe, you're on the planet that it's farthest from.
  - type: Dialogue
    character: THREEPIO
    text: I see, sir.
  - type: Dialogue

  - type: Dialogue
    character: LUKE
    text: Hello.
  - type: Action

    character: LUKE
    text: You got a lot of carbon scoring here. It looks like you boys have seen a lot of action.

    character: THREEPIO
    text: With all we've been through, sometimes I'm amazed we're in as good condition as we are, what with the Rebellion and all.

  - type: Dialogue
    character: LUKE
    text: Have you been in many battles?
  - type: Dialogue
    character: THREEPIO
    text: Several, I think. Actually, there's not much to tell. I'm not much more than an interpreter, and not very good at telling stories. Well, not at making them interesting, anyways.
  - type: Action
    text: Luke struggles to remove a small metal fragment from Artoo's neck joint. He uses a larger pick.
  - type: Dialogue
    character: LUKE
    text: Well, my little friend, you've got something jammed in here real good. Were you on a cruiser or...
  - type: Action
    text: The fragment breaks loose with a snap, sending Luke tumbling head over heels. He sits up and sees a twelve-inch threedimensional hologram of Leia Organa, the Rebel senator, being projected from the face of little Artoo. The image is a rainbow of colors as it flickers and jiggles in the dimly lit garage. Luke's mouth hangs open in awe.
  - type: Dialogue
    character: LEIA
    text: Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope.
  - type: Dialogue
    character: LUKE
    text: What's this?
  - type: Action
    text: Artoo looks around and sheepishly beeps an answer for Threepio to translate. Leia continues to repeat the sentence fragment over and over.
  - type: Dialogue
    character: THREEPIO
    text: What is what?!? He asked you a question...
  - type: Parenthetical
    character: THREEPIO
    text: pointing to Leia
  - type: Dialogue
    character: THREEPIO
    text: What is that?
  - type: Action

    character: LEIA
    text: Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope.
  - type: Dialogue
    character: THREEPIO
    text: Oh, he says it's nothing, sir. Merely a malfunction. Old data. Pay it no mind. Luke becomes intrigued by the beautiful girl.
  - type: Dialogue
    character: LUKE
    text: Who is she? She's beautiful.
  - type: Dialogue
    character: THREEPIO

  - type: Action
    text: Luke reaches out for Artoo but he lets out several frantic squeaks and a whistle.
  - type: Dialogue
    character: THREEPIO
    text: Behave yourself, Artoo. You're going to get us in trouble. It's all right, you can trust him. He's our new master.
  - type: Action
    text: Artoo whistles and beeps a long message to Threepio.
  - type: Dialogue
    character: THREEPIO
    text: He says he's the property of Obi-Wan Kenobi, a resident of these parts. And it's a private message for him. Quite frankly, sir I don't know what he's talking about. Our last master was Captain Antilles, but with what we've been through, this little R2 unit has become a bit eccentric.
  - type: Dialogue
    character: LUKE
    text: Obi-Wan Kenobi? I wonder if he means old Ben Kenobi?
  - type: Dialogue
    character: THREEPIO
    text: I beg your pardon, sir, but do you know what he's talking about?
  - type: Dialogue
    character: LUKE
    text: Well, I don't know anyone named Obi-Wan, but old Ben lives out beyond the dune sea. He's kind of a strange old hermit.
  - type: Action
    text: Luke's gazes at the beautiful young princess for a few moments.
  - type: Dialogue
    character: LUKE
    text: I wonder who she is. It sounds like she's in trouble. I'd better play back the whole thing. Artoo beeps something to Threepio.
  - type: Dialogue
    character: THREEPIO
    text: He says the restraining bolt has short circuited his recording system. He suggests that if you remove the bolt, he might be able to play back the entire recording. Luke looks longingly at the lovely, little princess and hasn't really heard what Threepio has been saying.
  - type: Dialogue
    character: LUKE
    text: H'm? Oh, yeah, well, I guess you're too small to run away on me if I take this off! Okay.
  - type: Action

  - type: Dialogue

  - type: Dialogue
    character: THREEPIO
    text: No, I don't think he likes you at all.
